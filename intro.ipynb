This example publishes three values: `time`, `val1`, and `val2` under a device named `DEVICE1`. `val1` and `val2` are random integers between 0-50 and 51-100, respectively. The `time` value is used by MDML's timeseries database, InfluxDB. InfluxDB uses Unix time in nanoseconds as the timestamp format for organizing data. It is strongly recommended to send a timestamp with each data message. If not, InfluxDB will use the time that the data was inserted. See [Helper Functions](#helper_functions) for a description of mdml.unix_time(). Follow the [README](https://github.com/anl-mdml/examples#tutorial-of-grafana-dashboard-basics) for a tutorial on creating a Grafana dashboard to view your streamed data."
