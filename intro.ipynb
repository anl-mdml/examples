The first step adds the config locally and runs some checks on the syntax. The second step actually sends the configuration to the MDML instance.

The `time` value is used by MDML's timeseries database, InfluxDB. InfluxDB uses Unix time in nanoseconds as the timestamp format for organizing data. It is strongly recommended to send a timestamp with each data message. If not, InfluxDB will use the time that the data was inserted. See [Helper Functions](#helper_functions) for a description of mdml.unix_time()."
